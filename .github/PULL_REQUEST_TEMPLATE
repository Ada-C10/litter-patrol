Consider the code on the first few lines of `App.render` (it starts with `this.state.items.map`). What is the Big-O time complexity of this code, where n is the number of active game items? | 
What part of React might benefit most from the use of specific data structure and algorithms? | 
Consider what happens when React processes a state change from `setState` -- it must re-render all of the components that now have different content because of that change.<br>What kind of data structure are the components in, and what sort of algorithms would be appropriate for React's code to "traverse" those components?<br>Speculate wildly about what the Big-O time complexity of that code might be. |
